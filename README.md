# TaskBuddy

Consider a real time situation where a common man 'x' have to relocate to a remote place. Since he is completely new to 
the place, he needs someone to guide him so that he can find the suitable place to reside. Since he donot have any direct 
contact, he cant find any help. Situation like this occurs more frequently than we think where we needs some help but cant 
find any. TaskBuddy is the app to help you in this situation and other situations like this.


## What is TaskBuddy ? 

An Android application build primarily for the service of "The Common Man", which focuses on providing a platform where 
people can help each other in exchange of some incentives (which in this application are credits). 


The Project is a tech hack developed for "Hack in the North 2.0" by Team - FSociety Coders 

(FSociety Coders is a team from NIT Hamirpur)

## The Core Idea!!
We are using 'Credits' as a commodity for exchange, Initially every user will be provided with 100 credits as a signup bonus. 
User can add more credits to his account by paying money. As well as redeem it to get goodies or money. 

Any app user can seek help by posting in app with some substential tags and with some credits. 
Each post can be made globally asking help to any app user or can be posted within a circle for which the user is a part.
